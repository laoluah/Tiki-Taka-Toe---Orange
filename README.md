# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎯  

**Live 🔗:** [My Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://laoluah.github.io/Tiki-Taka-Toe---Orange/)


This is my Tic-Tac-Toe game with a modern scoreband - I've given it a pun of "Tiki-Taka", which is a style of football. 

It's a modern and feature-rich Tic-Tac-Toe game with a scoreboard, target wins, and avatar selection. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Scoreboard** to track wins, losses, and ties  
✅ **Target to Win** - Set a custom goal to decide the match  
✅ **Avatar Choices** - Choose unique avatars for both players  
✅ **Interactive UI** I've tried to make it animations and responsive design  
✅ **Reset & New Game Options** for continuous play
